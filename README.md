### Audax

Long, self-supported rides, oversaw and validated by a national body ([Audax UK](http://www.aukweb.net/)
in the UK). Minimum and maximum average speeds including any kind of break are
enforced (usually 15 and 30 kph respectively). Distances are usually between
200 and 600 km, although longer rides may be organized.

### Super Audax Prototype

This bike was built by Stayer with Audax riding as its primary purpose. It began its operational life in
March 2017 and in one year has covered about 10,000 km, mostly but not exclusively in Audax rides.

This repository organizes together data, stories, etc. related to some of these rides.
